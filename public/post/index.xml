      <description>This blog post was originally written for OHI-Science.org
A significant portion of my work on the Ocean Health Index (OHI) involves working with raster data, a specific type of spatial data where values are held in grid cells. The data I work with varies from high resolution, remotely sensed data on sea surface temperature to coarse, modeled data on global fish catch. When I was working on the global assessment, I dealt with raster data at a global scale.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m excited to be part of a new research group - the Conservation Aquaculture Research Team at NCEAS. Our group is interested in helping shape the future of sustainable aquaculture. Over the past couple of decades, farmed seafood has grown significantly and is likely to become the dominant source of where we get our fish as global populations increase. I wanted to take a look at this trend over time using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</description>
